Devel::WxProf - heavy-weight subroutine profiler and graphical profile analyzer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT
-----

Devel::WxProf is a heavy-weight perl subroutine profiler and graphical profile
analyzer. In contrast to tools like Devel::DProf, which are more suitable
for profiling repeated runs, it is designed for one-shot profiling sessions.

Devel::WxProf uses a stopwatch approach, so profiling data is inaccurate on
systems with competing processes.

INSTALL
-------

To install, use the following mantra:

 perl Build.PL
 perl Build
 perl Build test
 perl Build install
